Notes taken from the documents observed in the manual evaluation. Note that some documents are not in English so the keywords and such
found directly in the document are direct translations of what is in the document. When we extract metadata, it is all extracted
in English (#TODO: so we could get these keywords' translations?)

- Practice abstracts: 
    (short documents with less visuals and more of a textual structure)
    - abstracts
    - policy briefs
    HEURISTIC: few pages, title/subtitle keywords like policy brief, practice abstract, recommendations
    NOTES:
    contain words like practice abstract, practical, solution, factsheet, recommendations, solution, problem, outcome, topic, keywords, context, roadmap...
    found a common 'about this abstract'/'about {project name}' section as well in some documents. they also usually show a grid of logos of partners/partnerships or a list with their partners. depends on whether it is a study abstract, because they might also have methodology/conclusion sections.
    not a lot of text, organized around the page in short sections. 1-2-3 pages (preferably more than 1? and at most 4? but cannot realy reject a doc of one page). they also usually have a sentence at the end
    explaining that the Project has received funding from the European Union's (whatever framework: e.g. Horizon 2020) under a given grant agreement.
    policy briefs have a similar structure to practice abstract only that they contain the 'policy brief' title and can also have recommendations. another keyword is 'for more information'/'more info'/'further information'

- Promotional: 
    (short documents w lots of artifacts)
    - brochure, flyer
    - factsheet
    - press releases and newsletters
    HEURISTIC: few pages, images, contact info, specific promotional language
    NOTES: contain news-related words (newsletter, news, 'boletín' in Spanish, kick-off, meeting, seminar, highlights)... 2-3 pages. also has the funding sentence at the end.

- Project structures: 
    (long documents, fancy cover page, table of contents, less academic)
    - reports: deliverables, milestones
    - books: guides, handbooks, manuals, tutorials, booklets
    HEURISTIC: lots of pages, tables of contents, specifics like 'deliverable'
    NOTES:
        you can have very short training modules/tutorials with short instructions/steps on how to use a given task. 
        Booklets have many pages, around 30, have a table of contents, artifacts, lot of text...
        on the other hand you can find very technical and structured reports of 100+ pages with a huge table of contents and with a science paper-like structure.
        project deliverables have the 'deliverable' keyword and specify due/submission/start dates of the project, duration, have 'objectives'/'motivation' and related sections and also comprise figures
        and a lot of text (6-25 pages). important keywords are 'version', 'acronym', 'conceptual framework', 'guidelines', 'report'
        educational materials and project summaries have a similar structure to reports only that much much shorter (less than 10 pages)
        you can also find structured deliverables that are a collection of practice abstracts, as per the table of contents
        guides have the 'guide' 'best practice' keywords

- Scientific/technical publications:
    (academic, high avg. char count per page, 2-col layouts, specific sections, citations, bibliography)
    - journal articles
    - articles in conference proceedings
    - chapters in edited volumes
    - thesis
    - review documents
    - tech articles
    HEURISTIC: text density, specific sections titled under abstract, intro, references, bibliography, methodology

- Others (unsupported): 
    NOTES:
    images requiring OCR and with artifacts/images, not enough text, more like flyers or super short practice abstracts
    documents comprising just tables with super short text are not validated
